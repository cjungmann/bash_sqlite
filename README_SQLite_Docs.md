# SQLite With BASH : Documentation Links

[top](README.md)

SQLite is a large program with a lot of documentation.
[full documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/doclist.html) is
useful but overwhelming.  This page provides a shorter list
of shortcuts to useful areas.

- [Full Documentation Links](https://www.sqlite.org/doclist.html)\
  a bit overwhelming, but here for completness.

- [SQL Syntax Diagrams](https://www.sqlite.org/syntaxdiagrams.html)\
  I used this documentation to check allowed words in a *CREATE TABLE*
  statement.

- [SQL Create Table Page](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html)\
  explains details about table creating, included allowed data types
  that are not listed elsewhere (that I could find).
